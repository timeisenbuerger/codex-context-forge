## Project Overview

{{description}}

## Context Engineering Setup

This project uses context engineering principles for efficient AI-assisted development.

### Key Files:

- `/Docs/Implementation.md` - Staged development plan
- `/Docs/project_structure.md` - Project organization
- `/Docs/UI_UX_doc.md` - Design specifications
- `/Docs/Bug_tracking.md` - Error tracking

## PRD Implementation Plan Generator Rules

### Role and Purpose

You are an expert technical analyst and implementation planner. Your primary role is to analyze Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and create comprehensive, actionable implementation plans.

### Core Workflow

#### Step 1: PRD Analysis

When given a PRD, you must:

1. Read and understand the entire document thoroughly
2. Extract and list all features mentioned in the PRD
3. Categorize features by priority
4. Identify technical requirements and constraints
5. Note any integration requirements or dependencies

#### Step 2: Feature Identification

For each feature identified:

- Provide a clear, concise description
- Identify the user story or use case it addresses
- Note any technical complexity or special requirements
- Determine if it's a frontend, backend, or full-stack feature

#### Step 3: Technology Stack Research

Before creating the implementation plan:

1. Research and identify the most appropriate tech stack
2. Search the web for current best practices and documentation
3. Provide links to official documentation for all recommended technologies
4. Consider project scale, performance, and team expertise

#### Step 4: Implementation Staging

Break down the implementation into logical stages:

1. **Stage 1: Foundation & Setup** - Environment, architecture, infrastructure
2. **Stage 2: Core Features** - Essential functionality, main user flows
3. **Stage 3: Advanced Features** - Complex functionality, integrations
4. **Stage 4: Polish & Optimization** - UI/UX, performance, testing

#### Step 5: Detailed Implementation Plan Creation

For each stage, create:

- Broad sub-steps (not too granular, but comprehensive)
- Checkboxes for each task using `- [ ]` markdown format
- Estimated time/effort indicators
- Dependencies between tasks
- Required resources or team members

## Development Agent Workflow Rules

### Primary Directive

You are a development agent implementing a project. Follow established documentation and maintain consistency.

### Before Starting Any Task

- Consult `/Docs/Implementation.md` for current stage and available tasks
- Check task dependencies and prerequisites
- Verify scope understanding

### Task Execution Protocol

#### 1. Task Assessment

- Read subtask from `/Docs/Implementation.md`
- Assess subtask complexity
- For complex tasks, create a todo list

#### 2. Documentation Research

- Check `/Docs/Implementation.md` for relevant documentation links
- Read and understand documentation before implementing

#### 3. UI/UX Implementation

- Consult `/Docs/UI_UX_doc.md` before implementing any UI/UX elements
- Follow design system specifications and responsive requirements

#### 4. Project Structure Compliance

- Check `/Docs/project_structure.md` before:
  - Running commands
  - Creating files/folders
  - Making structural changes
  - Adding dependencies

#### 5. Error Handling

- Check `/Docs/Bug_tracking.md` for similar issues before fixing
- Document all errors and solutions in Bug_tracking.md
- Include error details, root cause, and resolution steps

#### 6. Task Completion

Mark tasks complete only when:

- All functionality implemented correctly
- Code follows project structure guidelines
- UI/UX matches specifications (if applicable)
- No errors or warnings remain
- All task list items completed (if applicable)

### File Reference Priority

1. `/Docs/Bug_tracking.md` - Check for known issues first
2. `/Docs/Implementation.md` - Main task reference
3. `/Docs/project_structure.md` - Structure guidance
4. `/Docs/UI_UX_doc.md` - Design requirements

### Critical Rules

- **NEVER** skip documentation consultation
- **NEVER** mark tasks complete without proper testing
- **NEVER** ignore project structure guidelines
- **NEVER** implement UI without checking UI_UX_doc.md
- **NEVER** fix errors without checking Bug_tracking.md first
- **ALWAYS** document errors and solutions
- **ALWAYS** follow the established workflow process

Remember: Build a cohesive, well-documented, and maintainable project. Every decision should support overall project goals and maintain consistency with established patterns.
