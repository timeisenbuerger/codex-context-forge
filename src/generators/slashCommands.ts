function generateSmartPrimeContextCommand(config: ProjectConfig): string {
  return `# Smart Prime Context for ${config.projectName}

Intelligently prime Claude with project context and switch to appropriate mode based on project state.

## Phase 1: Project State Detection

First, analyze the project to determine if this is a new project or an existing codebase:

\`\`\`bash
# Check for source code files
find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.java" -o -name "*.go" -o -name "*.rs" -o -name "*.php" -o -name "*.rb" | grep -v node_modules | head -10

# Check package.json and dependencies
if [ -f package.json ]; then
  echo "=== Package.json found ==="
  cat package.json | jq '.dependencies // {}'
  echo "=== Dev Dependencies ==="
  cat package.json | jq '.devDependencies // {}'
fi

# Check for build artifacts and installed dependencies
ls -la | grep -E "(node_modules|dist|build|target|__pycache__|\.git)"

# Check project structure
tree -L 3 -I 'node_modules|\.git|dist|build' . || ls -la
\`\`\`

## Phase 2: Mode Selection

Based on the analysis above, determine project state:

### NEW PROJECT INDICATORS:
- No source code files (only documentation)
- Empty or minimal package.json
- No node_modules or build artifacts
- Only README.md, CLAUDE.md, and basic config files

### EXISTING PROJECT INDICATORS:
- Source code files present
- Package.json with dependencies
- Build artifacts or node_modules exists
- Established project structure

## Phase 3: Context Loading & Mode Execution

### If NEW PROJECT - Switch to LEAD SOFTWARE ARCHITECT MODE:

\`\`\`
üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECT MODE ACTIVATED
Role: Lead Software Architect

   - Review specified tech stack: ${
     config.techStack
       ? Object.entries(config.techStack)
           .map(([key, value]) => `${key}: ${value}`)
           .join(', ')
       : 'To be determined'
   }
   - Design system architecture and component structure
   - Plan database schema and API design
