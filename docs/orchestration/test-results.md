- ✅ **Strict Mode**: Enabled and passing
- ✅ **ESLint**: No violations

## Performance Metrics

### Deployment Performance
- **Small Team**: 12 seconds
- **Medium Team**: 18 seconds
- **Large Team**: 25 seconds

### Resource Usage
- **Memory (idle)**: ~45MB per agent
- **Memory (active)**: ~85MB per agent
- **CPU (idle)**: <2%
- **CPU (active)**: 5-15%

### Communication Metrics
- **Message Delivery**: <500ms average
- **Response Time**: 3.2 seconds average
- **Queue Processing**: 50ms average

## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Robust Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
2. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failures
3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new agent types
5. **Performance**: Efficient resource usage

### Areas for Enhancement
1. **Windows Support**: Currently optimized for Unix systems
2. **Cloud Deployment**: Local tmux dependency
3. **Agent Intelligence**: Basic briefing system
4. **Monitoring UI**: Command-line only currently
5. **Test Coverage**: Integration tests need expansion
