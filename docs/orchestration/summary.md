The Context Forge orchestration system has been successfully implemented, tested, and documented. This revolutionary feature enables autonomous AI agent teams to work on software projects 24/7 without human intervention.

## 🚀 What Was Built

### Core System Components

1. **OrchestrationService** (`src/services/orchestrationService.ts`)
   - 1,300+ lines of comprehensive orchestration logic
   - Handles agent deployment, monitoring, and coordination
   - Implements phased deployment strategies
   - Manages error recovery and reporting

2. **TmuxManager** (`src/services/tmuxManager.ts`)
   - Complete tmux session management
   - Claude CLI integration through tmux windows
   - Window content capture and monitoring
   - Proper timing for Claude message delivery

3. **AgentCommunicationService** (`src/services/agentCommunication.ts`)
   - Hub-and-spoke communication model
   - Message routing with hierarchy validation
   - Response time tracking and metrics
   - Escalation handling for critical issues

4. **SelfSchedulingService** (`src/services/selfScheduler.ts`)
   - Adaptive scheduling based on workload
   - Check-in intervals from 5-60 minutes
   - Recovery scheduling for failed agents
   - Process management with nohup

5. **GitDisciplineService** (`src/services/gitDiscipline.ts`)
   - Automatic commits every 30 minutes
   - Feature branch management
   - Commit message templating
   - Compliance tracking and reporting

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Deploy teams
context-forge orchestrate [small|medium|large]

# Options
-s, --strategy [big-bang|phased|adaptive]
-c, --communication [hub-and-spoke|hierarchical|mesh]
--no-git                  # Disable auto-commit
--no-scheduling           # Disable self-scheduling
--commit-interval <min>   # Git commit interval
--check-interval <min>    # Check-in interval
```

### Slash Commands

1. **`/orchestrate-project`** - Deploy full autonomous team
2. **`/orchestrate-feature`** - Deploy feature-focused team
3. **`/orchestrate-status`** - Check team status and metrics
4. **`/feature-status`** - Monitor feature implementation
