# Context Forge v3.2.0 Release Notes

## 🚀 Major Release: Autonomous AI Orchestration

We're thrilled to announce Context Forge v3.2.0, introducing groundbreaking **Autonomous AI Orchestration** capabilities that enable teams of AI agents to work on your projects 24/7 without human intervention.

### 🤖 What's New

#### Autonomous AI Teams
Deploy self-managing AI agent teams that collaborate on your software projects:
- **Small Team** (4 agents): Perfect for focused features
- **Medium Team** (5 agents): Balanced for most projects  
- **Large Team** (9 agents): Enterprise-scale development

#### Key Features

##### 🎯 Orchestration Command
```bash
context-forge orchestrate [small|medium|large]
```
- Three-tier hierarchy: Orchestrator → Project Managers → Developers/QA/DevOps
- Multiple deployment strategies: big-bang, phased, adaptive
- Communication models: hub-and-spoke, hierarchical, mesh

##### 🔄 Self-Scheduling System
- Agents schedule their own check-ins (5-60 minute intervals)
- Adaptive scheduling based on workload
- Automatic recovery from crashes
- Continuous 24/7 operation

##### 📝 Git Discipline
- Automatic commits every 30 minutes
- Feature branch creation
- Meaningful commit messages
- Work preservation guaranteed

##### 🖥️ Tmux Integration
- Real-time agent monitoring
- Isolated execution environments
- Health checks and status tracking
- `tmux attach -t cf-yourproject` to watch agents work

##### 📊 New Slash Commands
- `/orchestrate-project` - Deploy autonomous team
- `/orchestrate-feature` - Feature-focused team
- `/orchestrate-status` - Monitor team progress
- `/feature-status` - Track feature implementation

### 🛡️ Enhanced Security & Reliability

- **API Permission Checker**: Validates agent permissions before API calls
- **Hook Manager**: Robust handling of Python/JS/Shell hooks
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic agent restart strategies
- **Communication Validation**: Prevents unauthorized agent messaging

### 📈 Performance

- Small team deployment: <30 seconds
- Memory usage: ~45MB per agent (idle)
- 97.6% test coverage
- Zero critical errors in extended testing

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### New Services
- `OrchestrationService` - Central coordination
- `TmuxManager` - Session management
- `AgentCommunicationService` - Message routing
- `SelfSchedulingService` - Adaptive scheduling
- `GitDisciplineService` - Auto-commit enforcement
- `APIPermissionChecker` - Permission validation
- `HookManager` - Hook execution management

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive orchestration guide
- Step-by-step tutorial
- Implementation details
